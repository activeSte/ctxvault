# 03 · Persistent Memory Agent

An agent that accumulates context across sessions and retrieves it
semantically — days later, with different words.

This example demonstrates the persistent memory Core Principle directly:
a vault used not for document retrieval but as a living memory layer
that the agent writes to autonomously and queries across time.

---

## Scenario

Three sessions simulated across a week. In session one the agent saves
meeting notes, cost targets, and action items. In session two it recalls
them using semantically related language — "financial constraints" finds
"15% cost cut" written three days prior. In session three it synthesizes
patterns across all accumulated sessions.

This is not state restoration. LangGraph checkpointers can replay an
exact conversation — they cannot semantically search across multiple
sessions from different days. The vault provides that layer.

---

## What this demonstrates

- Agent writing to vault autonomously via the write API
- Semantic recall across sessions with fuzzy queries
- Cross-session synthesis from accumulated memory
- Vault as long-term memory, not just document index

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
python app.py
```

## What happens

**Session 1 — Monday**
The agent saves five interactions from the day into a single markdown
file in the vault. The session ends. Memory persists.

**Session 2 — Wednesday**
```
QUERY: What financial constraints did I mention?
→ Finds: "15% cost cut" + "competitor pricing 20% lower"

QUERY: Were there any action items?
→ Finds: "prepare slides by Friday" + "follow up on vendor negotiation"
```
The queries never mention "cost" or "slides" — semantic search finds
the relevant content by meaning.

**Session 3 — Monday (one week later)**
The agent adds new context, then retrieves broadly across both sessions
and synthesizes the week's themes, decisions, and next steps.

No pre-written documents — the agent generates its own memory files
at runtime.

### Inspect the memory vault

After running the demo, verify what the agent has written:
```bash
ctxvault docs assistant-memory
```
```
Found 2 documents in 'assistant-memory'

  1. session_2026-02-17_001.md
     .md · 3 chunks

  2. session_2026-02-24_002.md
     .md · 2 chunks
```

The agent generated these files autonomously during the sessions.
They persist on disk — run the demo again and the vault accumulates
further, or query it directly from the CLI at any time.

## Next

All three examples use the same vault primitive. **Example 01** shows
it as a document index. **Example 02** shows it as an isolated
per-agent knowledge base. This example shows it as long-term memory.
The infrastructure is the same — the topology changes.
