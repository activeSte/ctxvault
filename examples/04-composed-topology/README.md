# 04 · Composed Topology

Five vaults, three agents, one system. Each agent has a different
profile of access — private knowledge, shared technical context, and
a public base accessible to all.

This example builds on the isolation primitive of Example 02 and shows
how vault topologies compose: not just isolated silos, but a structured
knowledge graph where access boundaries reflect real organizational
boundaries.

## Scenario

A three-tier customer support system. Each tier has access to exactly
the knowledge it needs — no more.

- **L1 agent** — handles standard requests. Accesses public documentation
  and its own procedural vault. No visibility into technical internals.
- **L2 agent** — handles technical escalations. Accesses public docs,
  its own technical procedures, and a shared vault with known issues and
  internal tooling — shared with L3.
- **L3 agent** — handles engineering incidents. Accesses the shared
  technical vault and its own engineering runbooks with architecture
  notes and recovery procedures.

When L1 cannot resolve a ticket, it escalates to L2. When L2 cannot
resolve it, it escalates to L3. Each tier accumulates the context
retrieved by the previous one.

## Vault topology

```
public-vault   [PUBLIC]      →  l1-agent, l2-agent, l3-agent
l1-vault       [RESTRICTED]  →  l1-agent
l2-vault       [RESTRICTED]  →  l2-agent
l3-vault       [RESTRICTED]  →  l3-agent
tech-vault     [RESTRICTED]  →  l2-agent, l3-agent
```

L1 and L3 have no shared retrieval path. L1 cannot reach technical
internals. L3 cannot reach L2's procedures. The boundaries are
structural — not enforced by routing logic or prompt rules.

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
```

### 2. Inspect the topology
```bash
ctxvault vaults
```

```
Found 5 vaults

> public-vault [PUBLIC]
  path:    .../vaults/public-vault

> l1-vault [RESTRICTED]
  path:    .../vaults/l1-vault
  agents:  l1-agent

> l2-vault [RESTRICTED]
  path:    .../vaults/l2-vault
  agents:  l2-agent

> l3-vault [RESTRICTED]
  path:    .../vaults/l3-vault
  agents:  l3-agent

> tech-vault [RESTRICTED]
  path:    .../vaults/tech-vault
  agents:  l2-agent, l3-agent
```

### 3. Run
```bash
python app.py
```

## What happens

Three tickets are routed through the system in sequence, each requiring
a different tier to resolve.

**Ticket 1** — password reset, resolved at L1. Public FAQ and L1
procedures are sufficient. No escalation.

**Ticket 2** — webhook timeout on large payloads, escalated to L2.
L1 cannot diagnose integration issues. L2 finds the known issue in
tech-vault and provides the workaround.

**Ticket 3** — data corruption in production, escalated to L3. L2
identifies it as an engineering incident and escalates. L3 retrieves
the recovery procedure from its runbooks and the incident context
from tech-vault.
